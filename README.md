# GitHub Copilot assisted MVC Music Store

This is a sample project that re-implements the old MVC Music Store sample application from MVC3 days, but uses GitHub Copilot to assist with coding.

You should find prompts that were used to generate code in most of the files in the project.

There is an associated workshop which details the steps for this project, but this workshop is currently not publicly available.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to run the associated workshop.
